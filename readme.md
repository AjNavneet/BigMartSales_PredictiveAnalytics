# BigMart Sales Predictive Analytics

## Overview
Sales forecasting is critical for businesses to allocate resources, manage cash flow, and meet customer expectations. The BigMart Sales Prediction project explores data processing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of various machine-learning models to predict product sales in different stores.

## Data Description
The dataset contains annual sales records for 1559 products across ten stores in different cities. Key attributes include:
- `item_identifier`: Unique item identifier
- `item_weight`: Item weight
- `item_fat_content`: Fat content in the item
- `item_visibility`: Product visibility in the outlet
- `item_type`: Product category
- `item_mrp`: Maximum retail price
- `outlet_identifier`: Outlet identifier
- `outlet_establishment_year`: Year of outlet establishment
- `outlet_size`: Outlet size
- `outlet_location_type`: Outlet location type
- `outlet_type`: Outlet type
- `item_outlet_sales`: Overall sales of the product in the outlet
